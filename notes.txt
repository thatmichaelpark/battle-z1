Server broadcasts state of entire world.

Each client sees State: [thing0, thing1, thing2...]

thing: {
  type: 'tank' | 'bullet' | 'cube' | 'halfcube' | 'pyramid'
  x: #
  y: #
  h: #
  color: 'green' | #xxxxxx
  state: moving, firing, hit, dead
}

Server side:

socket.id -> playerId (so incoming move on socket gets assigned to correct player)


to do:
add dt to world state (so clients can animate volcano)
GBOF
remove players on disconnection
analog controls
health/death/scoring
