Server broadcasts state of entire world.

Each client sees State: [thing0, thing1, thing2...]

thing: {
  type: 'tank' | 'bullet' | 'cube' | 'halfcube' | 'pyramid'
  x: #
  y: #
  h: #
  state: normal, hit, dead
}

Server side:

socket.id -> playerId (so incoming move on socket gets assigned to correct player)


to do:
analog controls
health/death/scoring
calming screen?
